     * Called to have the fragment instantiate its user interface view.
     * This is optional, and non-graphical fragments can return null. This will be called between
     * [.onCreate] and [.onViewCreated].
     *
     * A default View can be returned by calling [.Fragment] in your
     * constructor. Otherwise, this method returns null.
     *
     *
     * It is recommended to **only** inflate the layout in this method and move
     * logic that operates on the returned View to [.onViewCreated].
     *
     *
     * If you return a View from here, you will later be called in
     * [.onDestroyView] when the view is being released.
     *
     * @param inflater The LayoutInflater object that can be used to inflate
     * any views in the fragment,
     * @param container If non-null, this is the parent view that the fragment's
     * UI should be attached to.  The fragment should not add the view itself,
     * but this can be used to generate the LayoutParams of the view.
     * @param savedInstanceState If non-null, this fragment is being re-constructed
     * from a previous saved state as given here.
     *
     * @return Return the View for the fragment's UI, or null.
